Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) measures performance only among 15-year-olds who are enrolled in education. 65 countries and economies have participated in PISA 2012. This visualization focuses on performance of mathematics.

What would be the average performance of education system if all students had the OECD-average socio-economic status? 
Most education systems perform similarly before and after accounting for socio-economic status. However, these are the only three countries that would climb more than 10 positions in their performance rankings if socio-economic status were taken into account. 

Portugal would perform above the OECD average if socio-economic status were taken into account. Turkeyâ€™s performance would also improve from below average to average. Among the partner economies, Viet Nam would markedly improve its rankings if socio-economic status were taken into account.

- World map is used to introduce participating countries around the world.
- Slopegraph is a good way to visualize ranking changes when socio-economic status were taken into account.
